# Autoencoder neural networks for audio distortion effect

This repo is only intended to store sample audio files from the paper *Modeling Audio Distortion Effects with
Autoencoder Neural Networks*.

The folders `Mono_Notes` and `Poly_Notes` contain respectively single notes and chords example. Inside each of the two folders there are three files: one is the dataset example, the target sound, the other two are the results obtained by processing the clean sounds from the dataset with the two different networks.

The folder `Clean_Notes` contains the clean sounds that were processed by the networks.

The dataset files are taken from the **IDMT-SMT-Audio-Effects** (www.idmt.fraunhofer.de/en/business_units/m2d/smt/audio_effects.html)
